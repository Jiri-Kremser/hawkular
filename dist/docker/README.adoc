= Hawkular in Docker

This explains a bit building and running Hawkular in Docker

== Build the Docker image

Make sure you are in `hawkular/dist` directory and have Docker running
(try running `docker ps` before the next step).

.Simple build
[source,shell]
----
mvn package docker:build
----

.Build of a development container:
[source,shell]
----
mvn -Pdev,dozip package docker:build
----

The development container has a user _jdoe/password_ built in and this thus
also able to run the Hawkular agent that is embedded in the Hawkular server.

== Running Hawkular

The Hawkular container is by default self-contained for quick start. You may want to look at the options below
regarding the persistence of data.

=== With the embedded Cassandra

The Hawkular image provides an integrated Cassandra instance for quick testing purposes, which is used
by default if you do not provide any additional settings.

.NOTE Embedded Cassandra is not recommended for serious testing or even production use.

[source,shell]
----
docker run -dP --name hawkular hawkular:snapshot
docker port hawkular
----

=== Mounting an explicit external data directory

With the above, the storage for embedded Cassandra an other system data
lives inside a file created the container and thus goes away when the container is deleted.
This may be very welcome for testing purposes, but not so if the data should
be re-used over container upgrades. In this case it is possible to mount an external
data directory via Docker's `-v` flag:

.Mount host directory `/tmp/h` in to the container
[source,shell]
----
docker run -dP --name hawkular -v /tmp/h:/opt/data hawkular:snapshot  #<1>
docker port hawkular
----
<1> Note that the host dir on e.g. OS/X needs to live inside the users home
running Docker. See https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume


=== With Cassandra on the host (outside of Docker)

If you already have a Cassandra instance/cluster up and running, you can use this for storage.
In this case you need to provide the IP-address(es) of the hosts running Cassandra in the
`CASSANDRA_NODES` environment variable.

.Run Hawkular with Cassandra outside the container.
[source,shell]
--
docker run -dP  -e HAWKULAR_BACKEND=cassandra -e CASSANDRA_NODES=10.1.2.3 hawkular:snapshot #<1>
--
<1> Here Cassandra runs on host 10.1.2.3

=== With Cassandra in a Docker container

It is possible to use a linked Cassandra Docker container. For this to work you need to
first start Cassandra and then Hawkular.

.NOTE Hawkular from Alpha5 on needs Cassandra 2.2.x - so best use an image with the _2.2_ tag.

.Start the Cassandra container
[source,shell]
--
docker run --name my_cassandra -d cassandra:2.2  # <1>
--
<1> We have provided an explicit container name of _my_cassandra_ to distinguish it from other potentially available
Cassandra containers. If you don't provide a name _cassandra_ is taken.

.Run Hawkular with a link to the above Cassandra container
[source,shell]
--
docker run  --link my_cassandra -e HAWKULAR_BACKEND=cassandra -e CASSANDRA_NODES=my_cassandra -P  hawkular:snapshot
--

It is important to use the name of the Cassandra container from above (_my_cassandra_) both for the name of the
link and also the environment variable for Cassandra nodes.

See also https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/cassandra/ for more information about Cassandra in Docker

=== Mounting an external data directory for Cassandra

By default Cassandra is using a technique to mount a host volume as data directory, that stays
valid as long as the container is not deleted (you can restart it though). As with Hawkular above,
you can mount an explicit host directory to be used.

.Run Cassandra with external data directory
[source,shell]
--
docker run -v /Users/hrupp/tmp/cassandra:/var/lib/cassandra/data --name my_cassandra -d  cassandra:2.2
--

=== Using docker-compose

Docker has a tool http://docs.docker.com/compose/[`docker-compose`], that can be used to instrument a full application
 including linking of containers.

You need to separately http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[download compose] footnote:[This is now embedded in
the Docker Toolbox for OS/X] and can then start
Hawkular with a linked Cassandra container:

[source,shell]
--
docker-compose up
--
