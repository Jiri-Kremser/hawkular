This module is the integration point of Hawkular
and mostly consists of configuration and assembly snippets.

Mazz explains it like this:

.The Kettle
____
Fillet of a pinger snake, In the kettle boil and bake; Eye of bus and toe of frog,
Wool of cassandra and tongue of dog, Alert's fork and blind-worm's metrics,
Inventory's leg and owlet's wing, For a charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and kettle bubble.
____

== Building

You can build the Kettle and thus the integrated server with

[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----

You may need to pass option `-Dlicense.check` if you see the license checker complain on generated java script files.
If you pass option `-Pdev` you will get an unzipped server in `target/ `.

== Running

When you have unzipped the server or are using `Pdev` in the above step, you can switch into its directory and start
it

[source,shell]
----
cd wildfly-8.2.0.Final
bin/standalone.sh
----
